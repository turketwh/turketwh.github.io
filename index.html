<HR>
I am an Associate Professor in the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wfu.edu">Department of Computer Science</A> at <A HREF="http://www.wfu.edu">Wake Forest University</A>. I received my Ph.D. in 2004 from the <A HREF="http://www.cse.sc.edu">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</A> at the  <A HREF="http://www.sc.edu">University of South Carolina</A>, where my research was in the area of probabilistic reasoning. My BS in Computer Science (1998) was from the <A HREF="http://www.cs.cofc.edu">College of Charleston</A>.<P>

During the 2018-2019 academic year, my service roles include being Associate Chair of the Department of Computer Science, being a member of the University's Learning Spaces Committee, representing the Graduate School to the University's Committee on Information Technology (CIT), and acting as an advisory board member for the University's <a href="http://molecularsignaling.wfu.edu">Center for Molecular Communication and Signaling</a>. 
<P>
I am helping to design a new <A HREF="http://graduate.wfu.edu/admissions/BMI.html">Biomedical Informatics MS program</A>.  
<P>
In Summer 2015, I was involved in the first WFU Schools of Business Summer Business Analytics Program, teaching a Data Management course as part of the curriculum, focusing on Databases, Big Data.  From 2008 to 2013, I directed the <A HREF="http://www.wfu.edu/EuroTour">EuroTour Study Abroad program</A>.

<H3>Teaching</H3>
In Fall 2018, I will be teaching the following courses:
<UL>
<LI> CSC/BIO/PHY 385/685 - Bioinformatics
<LI> CSC 341/641 - Operating Systems
</UL>
I made use of Standards-Based/Specification Grading in my upper level "Parallel Programming" course in Spring 2017 and plan to use it in other CS courses in the future.  For my thoughts on that experience, please see <A HREF="http://cloud.lib.wfu.edu/blog/turkettlab/">my academic blog</A>, and this <A HREF="http://cloud.lib.wfu.edu/blog/turkettlab/2017/05/24/standards-based-grading-semester-review-part-1/">post</A> specifically.<P>
<H3>Talks</H3>

<H3>Research</H3>
<I>Background:</I> My thesis advisor was <A HREF="http://www.cse.sc.edu/~rose/">Dr. John Rose</A>, who directed my dissertation work on <A HREF="docs/turkettDissertation.pdf">Robust Multiagent Plan Generation and Execution with Decision-Theoretic Planners</A> [PDF, ~1.0MB].<P>
<I>Interests:</I> At Wake Forest, I am actively involved in teaching and research in the broad field of <A HREF="http://www.compbiosci.wfu.edu">Computational Biosciences</A>, including active collaboration with colleagues in Computer Science, Mathematics, Biology, Physics, and on our Medical School campus. My interests are in applications of machine learning, with current foci on prediction and classification based on DNA and amino acid sequence analysis.  I have also been involved in collaborations with the Network Security Group in CS at WFU, led by <A HREF="http://csweb.cs.wfu.edu/~fulp/">Errin Fulp</A>. <P>

Almost all of my work deals with datasets that are sequential or temporal in nature and are systems-scale. I have some interests in Green Computing, Big Data Analytics Algorithms, and Computer Science Education .<P>
<I>Students:</I> I am looking for graduate students to work with on Masters level research. Some example projects will be listed here soon!  
<P>
I am currently working with the following student(s):
<UL>
<LI> Jiajie Xiao - Using k-mer representations in functional classification of peroxiredoxin proteins 
</UL>
Recently, I worked with the following student(s):
<UL>
<LI>Steven Johnson - Fast enumerative algorithm for modification-targeted sequence analysis
<LI>Charchil Gupta - Discovery of process attributes by dynamic analysis 
</UL>
If you are a current WFU undergraduate student and interested in working with me on research, please send an email.  I encourage you to look at the <A HREF="http://college.wfu.edu/ureca/wfrf">Wake Forest Summer Research Fellowship Program</A> as a means of being paid to do research. If you are a current WFU graduate student and want to discuss research, make sure to come to my CSC 781 talk, then send me an email.
